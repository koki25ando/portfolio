       I am a Japanese University Student, currently an exchange student at
       the University of Sydney. </br>
       I've been interested programming languages for months, it is really facsinating to be able to write some codes and build something.
       It has been really interesting. Recently I got interested in data science,
       so the main language I have been using is R, but I am trying to do as many things as
       possible.</br>
       I hope those skills will work at some point in my future.
